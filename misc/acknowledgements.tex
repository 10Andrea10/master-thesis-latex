    \textbf{Acknowledgements}
\end{center}

\noindent I would like to express my gratitude to my parents, Fabio and Daniela, for their steady support throughout my academic journey. They have always encouraged me to pursue my passions and have provided me with the freedom to explore my interests without any reservations.

\noindent My sister, Jenny, deserves a special mention for her constant presence and support during challenging times.

\noindent I am grateful to the friends I made during my two years abroad. Together, we embarked on countless adventures and shared enriching experiences. I hope that these friendships will endure for years to come.

\noindent I extend my sincere appreciation to my thesis supervisor, Dr. Jonathan Hei√ü, for giving me the opportunity to work on this project from the inception of my studies in Berlin. His guidance and support have been crucial in developing this thesis.

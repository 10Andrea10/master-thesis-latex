	abstract = {Blockchain technology promises a decentralized ecosystem for building apps with decentralized ownership and high security level. One of the most adopted blockchain ecosystems is based around Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum currently has a huge scaling issue, making its use very expensive. Different scaling solutions are proposed based on Optimistic rollups but they have a very long finality time. ZeroKnowledge (ZK) rollup (based on ZK Proof) is another way and offers high security with very fast final resolution. Problem with ZK rollup is that it is very computationally expensive, but some solutions have significant performance improvements. In this paper we presented different solutions that improve performance of ZK rollup.},

	abstract = {Ethereum is a very popular blockchain platform. However, due to the limit of the Transaction Per Second (TPS) of this platform, the transaction processing time in Ethereum is very slow, which greatly aﬀects the user experience and wastes time and other fees. Therefore, the scalability of Ethereum becomes an urgent problem to be solved. In this study, we try to improve the scalability problem of Ethereum by building a layer 2 with the zk-Rollup protocol. An evaluation of the implementation is also conducted. Experimental results show that the cost of transactions decreases depending on the batch size, with the gas cost decreasing by more than 85\% for a batch size of 50 transactions. Other evaluation results reveal that deposits incur the most cost and increase faster with the batch size.},

	abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

	abstract = {As one of the key technologies of distributed ledgers, blockchain solves the trust problem in open network without relying on any trusted third party. Its decentralized feature has a broad application prospect, but still faces scalability problem. Currently, blockchain scalability bottleneck is mainly in three aspects: performance inefficiency, high confirmation delay, and function extension. For example, Bitcoin can only deal with 7 transactions per second averagely. Obviously, it cannot meet the requirement of current digital payment scenarios, nor can it be carried in other applications such as distributed storage and credit service. What’s more, different blockchain systems carry different business and requirements, so scalability is the core issue of the current development of blockchain. This paper introduces the blockchain scalability related technologies from the aspects of improving efficiency and extending functionality of blockchain system, respectively. We summarize four mainstream solutions to improve the performance of blockchain system, including Sharding mechanism, directed acyclic graph based (DAG-based), off-chain payment network and cross-chain technology. In the end, we give some suggestions for further research in blockchain scalability.},

	abstract = {Most permissionless blockchains inherently suffer from throughput limitations. Layer-2 systems, such as side-chains or Rollups, have been proposed as a possible strategy to overcome this limitation. Layer-2 systems interact with the main-chain in two ways. First, users can move funds from/to the main-chain to/from the layer-2. Second, layer-2 systems periodically synchronize with the main-chain to keep some form of log of their activity on the main-chain - this log is key for security. Due to this interaction with the main-chain, which is necessary and recurrent, layer-2 systems impose some load on the main-chain. The impact of such load on the main-chain has been, so far, poorly understood. In addition to that, layer-2 approaches typically sacrifice decentralization and security in favor of higher throughput. This paper presents an experimental study that analyzes the current state of Ethereum layer-2 projects. Our goal is to assess the load they impose on Ethereum and to understand their scalability potential in the long-run. Our analysis shows that the impact of any given layer-2 on the main-chain is the result of both technical aspects (how state is logged on the main-chain) and user behavior (how often users decide to transfer funds between the layer-2 and the main-chain). Based on our observations, we infer that without efficient mechanisms that allow users to transfer funds in a secure and fast manner directly from one layer-2 project to another, current layer-2 systems will not be able to scale Ethereum effectively, regardless of their technical solutions. Furthermore, from our results, we conclude that the layer-2 systems that offer similar security guarantees as Ethereum have limited scalability potential, while approaches that offer better performance, sacrifice security and lead to an increase in centralization which runs against the end-goals of permissionless blockchains.},

This advancement has brought up a critical challenge that public blockchain systems face, which is scalability. Most of the currently deployed systems fail to cope with increasing usage. In order to provide the promised security guarantees, large delays and high usage fees are imposed for submitted transactions and thus widespread adoption of the technology is hindered. A number of different approaches have been proposed to increase the capacity of blockchain systems with respect to processing transactions. The present survey focuses on one of the most popular ones, that of state channels, and to the extent of our knowledge constitutes the ﬁrst collective survey of research in this ﬁeld. An extensive analysis of relevant publications is conducted and a general view on the domain is provided. We have identiﬁed the limitations discussed through all relevant research efforts along with the various features that differentiate proposed designs. A comparison between retrieved papers is carried out on the basis of those limitations and features. Finally, future research directions are analysed while the role of state channels in the general public blockchain ecosystem is also discussed.},
